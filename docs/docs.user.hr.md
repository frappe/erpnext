The Human Resources (HR) Module covers the processes linked to administering a team of co-workers. Most common among this is processing payroll by using the Salary Manager to generate Salary Slips. Most countries have complex tax rules stating what expenses can the company made on behalf of Employees and also expect the company to deduct taxes and social security from their payroll.

Apart from that you can also track Leave Applications and balances, Expense Claims and upload Attendance data (even though the world has moved to a result-oriented culture, some countries still mandate companies to maintain an attendance register to ensure you are not over-working your team).

You can also create a template for Appraisals and also record the performance using the Appraisal record.

> Confession: No, we don’t like the terms human “resources” and “employees” either, but since this terms are widely used and accepted for administrative procedures, we will use them here.
