A Stock Entry is a simple document that lets you record Item movement from a Warehouse, to a Warehouse and between Warehouses.

To make a Stock Entry you have to go to:

> Stock > Stock Entry

This can also be useful in tracking:

- Material Issues from Stores
- Sales and Purchase Returns
- Production (manufacturing).

We will look into the special features of the Stock Entry later when we discuss Accounting and Manufacturing processes.


In the Stock Entry you have to update the Items table with all your transactions. For each row, you must enter a “Source Warehouse” or a “Target Warehouse” or both (if you are recording a movement).

> **Note:** To update Stock from a spreadsheet, see Stock Reconciliation.
