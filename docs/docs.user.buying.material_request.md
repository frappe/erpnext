A Material Request is a simple document identifying a requirement of a set of Items (products or services) for a particular reason.

A Material Request can be generated:

- By a User.
- Automatically from a Sales Order.
- Automatically when the Projected Quantity (more on this later) of an Item in stores reaches a particular level.
- Automatically from your Bill of Materials if you use Production Plan to plan your manufacturing. (more on this later too)

To generate a Material Request manually go to:

> Buying > Material Request > New Material Request

In the Material Request form, 

- Fill in the Items you want and their quantities.
- If your Items are inventory items, you must also mention the Warehouse where you expect these Items to be delivered to. This helps you to keep track of the Projected Quantity for this Item.
- You can also automatically get the Items from a Sales Order.
- You can optionally add the Terms, using the Terms and Conditions master and also the reason.

> Info: Material Request is not mandatory. It is ideal if you have centralized buying so that you can collect this information from various departments.

#### Authorization

If you want your Material Request to be authorized by a senior person like a Purchase Manager then you can give “Submit” rights only to that person. Everyone can create requests, but only the authorized person can “Submit”.
