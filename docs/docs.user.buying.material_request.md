A Material Request is a simple document identifying a requirement of a set of Items (products or services) for a particular reason.

To generate a Material Request manually go to:

> Buying > Material Request > New Material Request

**Step 1**

A Material Request can be generated:

- By a User.
- Automatically from a Sales Order.
- Automatically when the Projected Quantity of an Item in stores reaches a particular level.
- Automatically from your Bill of Materials if you use Production Plan to plan your manufacturing activities.

**Step 2**

In the Material Request form, 

- Fill in the Items you want and their quantities.

- If your Items are inventory items, you must also mention the Warehouse where you expect these Items to be delivered. This helps to keep track of the [Projected Quantity](docs.user.stock.projected_quantity.html)for this Item.


- You can optionally add the Terms, using the Terms and Conditions master and also the reason.


> Info: Material Request is not mandatory. It is ideal if you have centralized buying so that you can collect this information from various departments.

#### Authorization

If you want your Material Request to be authorized by a senior person like a Purchase Manager then you can give “Submit” rights only to that person. Everyone can create requests, but only the authorized person can “Submit”.
