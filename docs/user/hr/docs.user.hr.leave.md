### Leave Allotment

Fixed number of leaves per Employee can be allocated using the Leave Allocation Tool. If you have special leaves to be allocated, you can also allocate them manually by creating new Leave Allocation records.

### Leave Application

If your company has a formal system where Employees have to apply for leaves to be able to qualify as paid leaveas, you can create Leave Application to track approval and usage of leaves. You have to mention the Employee, Leave Type and the period for which the leave is taken. If you want specific users to approve leaves, you can give “Submission” rights to those users only.

> HR > Leave Application > Make New Leave Application

If you want all users to create their own Leave Applications, you can set their “Employee ID” as a match rule in the Leave Application Permission settings. See the earlier discussion on permission settings for more info. [Permissions](docs.user.setup.permissions.html)
