The Human Resources (HR) Module covers the processes linked to managing a team of co-workers. Most important feature here is processing the payroll by using the Salary Manager to generate Salary Slips. Most countries have complex tax rules stating which expenses the company can make on behalf of the Employees. There are a set of rules for the company to deduct taxes and social security from employee payroll. ERPNext allows to accomodate all types of taxes and their calculation.

It  also maintains a complete employee database including contact information, salary details, attendance, performance evaluation, and appraisal records.
