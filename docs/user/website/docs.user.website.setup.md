## Layout

#### Top Bar

The header has two main parts, the “Brand” or the logo section and the menu items. These menu items can directly link to Web Pages or the Blogs page or Products page. The standard Website header bar is with black background.

#### Background

The website is generated using a standard width of 900 pixels and has a page “effect”. You can set a background color or image to enhance the effect of the page.

#### Content

The inner content of your pages has a width of 800px and if it is a two-column layout like Blog, it will have a width of 540 px.

#### Footer

The footer section contains a list of links (this is where you typical put links like “Contact Us”, “Terms and Conditions” etc) and the name of your company.

#### Top Menu

Add each top menu item on a new link.
In the label column, add the label of the item.
In the URL column, enter the name of the page or a full URL. If you want a new Web Page to open, just put the “Page Name” + “.html”. (URL is simply a web address like “http://google.com”)

Similarly you can also set the Footer section to contain links. If you want to have links appear as a drop-down under another link, just add the name of the parent menu in “Parent Label”.

#### Brand

To set your brand, create a logo with a transparent background and white foreground of roughly height 24px and length of 150px, attach it to the Website Settings page, and add it in your Brand section as an image as follows:
