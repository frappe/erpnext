Websites are a core component of any business and having a good website usually means:

- Invest lot of money.
- Difficult to update.
- Not interactive.

Unless you are a web designer yourself. 

Wouldn't it be nice if there was a way to update your product catalog on your site automatically from your ERP? 

We thought exactly the same and hence built a small Website Development app right inside ERPNext! Using ERPNext’s Website module, you can

1. Create Web Pages
1. Write a Blog
1. Publish your Product Catalog using the Item master

We will soon be adding a shopping cart facility so that your customers can place orders and pay you online!

Though not necessary, to make a good website, you might have to know a bit of HTML / CSS or hire the services of a professional. The good part is that once this is setup, you can add and edit content, blogs and products directly from your ERP.
