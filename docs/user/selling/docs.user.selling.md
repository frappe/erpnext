Selling is the communication that happens with the customer prior to and during the sale. You might be managing all the communication yourself or you may have a small team of sales people to handle this. ERPNext helps you track the communication leading up to the sale, by keeping all your documents in an organized and searchable manner.

ERPNext helps you track business **Opportunities** from **Leads** and **Customers**, send them **Quotations** and make confirmed **Sales Orders**.
