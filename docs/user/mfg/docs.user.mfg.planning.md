Production Planning Tool helps you plan production and purchase of Items for a period (usually a week or a month).

This list of Items can be generated from the open Sales Orders in the system and will generate:

- Production Orders for each Item.
- Purchase Requests for Items whose Projected Quantity is likely to fall below zero.

To use the Production Planning Tool, go to: 

> Manufacturing > Production Planning Tool

The Production Planning Tool is used in two stages:

- Selection of Open Sales Orders for the period based on “Expected Delivery Date”.
- Selection of Items from those Sales Orders.
- Click on “Raise Production Orders” 

The tool will update if you have already created Production Orders for this Item against this Sales Order (“Planned Quantity”).

You can always edit the Item list and increase / reduce quantities to plan your production.

> Note: How do you change a Production Plan? The output of the Production Planning Tool is the Production Order. Once your orders are created, you can change them by amending the Production Orders.
