Customers can check the status of their orders, invoices, and shipping status by logging on to the web.

Once an order is raised, either using the Shopping Cart or from within ERPNext, your customer can view the order and keep an eye on the billing and shipment status. When the invoice and payment against these orders are submitted, the customer can see the updated status on the portal, at a glance.
