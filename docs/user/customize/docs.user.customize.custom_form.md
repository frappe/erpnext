Select the Form you want to customize and the fields table will be updated with the fields from that form. Here you can:

- Change field types (for e.g. you want to increase the number of decimal places, you can convert some fields from Float to Currency).
- Change labels to suit your industry / language.
- Make certain fields mandatory.
- Hide certain fields.
- Change layout (sequence of fields). To do this, select a field in the grid and click on “Up” or “Down” in the grid toolbar.
- Add / edit “Select” Options. (for example, you can add more sources in Leads etc).

You can also allow attachments, set max number of attachments and set the default Print Format.

> Though we want you to do everything you can to customize your ERP based on your business needs, we recommend that you do not make “wild” changes to the forms. This is because, these changes may affect certain operations and may mess up your forms. Make small changes and see its effect before doing some more.
