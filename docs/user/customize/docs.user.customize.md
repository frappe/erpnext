ERPNext offers many tools to customize the system.

You simplify the forms by hiding features you don’t need using Disable Features and Module Setup, add Custom Fields, change form properties, like adding more options to drop-downs or hiding fields using Customize Form View and make your own Print Formats by using HTML Templates. You can also create multiple Letter Heads for your Prints.
