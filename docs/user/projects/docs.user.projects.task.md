## Tasks

Project is divided into Tasks and each Task is allocated to a resource. In ERPNext, you can also create and allocate a Task independently of a Project. If you define the start and end dates, it will add calendar events for the same and also show the task on the Gantt Chart that you can use for monitoring the Project.
