All the data that you enter in ERPNext is stored in database tables. An easy way to visualize this is to imagine each type of data like Customer, Sales Invoice, Task is stored in a separate spreadsheets, each containing all the data included in one table.

ERPNext gives you a simple tool called the Report Builder to extract data from these tables and show them in rows and columns where you can pick and choose which column to display and filter and sort the data by different parameters.

To start a new report click on the “Report” menu in the top toolbar or on the list page of any transaction click on the “Build Report” button. For example, to make a report of Sales Invoices, go to

> Accounts > Sales Invoice > Build Report

### Exporting

If you have “Report Manager” or “System Manager” permission, you can export the data from the Report Building via CSV to your favorite Spreadsheet application where you can do further analysis, apply formulas, make graphs etc.Selecting Columns
￼
You can select columns by clicking on “Pick Columns”. Select the column you want from the drop-down.

You can also select columns from the “child tables”. For example if you have selected Sales Invoice, you can select columns from the Sales Invoice Item table also.

### Adding Filters
￼
You can also add multiple filters by clicking on the “Show Filters” button.

### Saving

You can also save your selection of columns and filters by clicking on the “Save” button. You might need “System Manager” or “Report Manager” privileges for this. When you save a report, it will appear in the “Reports” section of the module page.
