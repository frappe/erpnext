This tutorial shows you how to set payment terms in ERPNext. Payment Terms help in defining the multiple payment slabs during sales or purchase transactions.

In Payment Terms you can define the breakup of the payment to be received (or made) in terms of different payment modes and the period after the due date. You can also create templates to quickly load the payment terms in a transaction.
