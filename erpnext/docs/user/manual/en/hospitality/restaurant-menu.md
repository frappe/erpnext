# Restaurant Menu

For every restaurant you must set an active Restaurant Menu from which orders can be placed. You can also set the rates for each of the item for the day.

When you save the Restaurant Menu, a Price List is created for that Menu and all pricing is linked to that price list. This way you can easily control the items on offer and pricing from the menu.
