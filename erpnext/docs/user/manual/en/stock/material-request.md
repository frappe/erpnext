A Material Request can be generated:

  * Automatically from a Sales Order.
  * Automatically when the Projected Quantity of an Item in stores reaches a particular level.
  * Automatically from your Bill of Materials if you use Production Plan to plan your manufacturing activities.
  * If your Items are inventory items, you must also mention the Warehouse where you expect these Items to be delivered. This helps to keep track of the [Projected Quantity](/docs/user/manual/en/stock/projected-quantity.html) for this Item.

A Material Request can be of type:

* Purchase - If the request material is to be purchased.
* Material Transfer - If the requested material is to be shifted from one warehouse to another.
* Material Issue - If the requested material is to be Issued.
* Manufacture - If the requested material is to be Produced.

The User can also raise a [Request For Quotation](/docs/user/manual/en/buying/request-for-quotation.html) against a Material Request. To create a Request For Quotation the user can click on 'Make'.

> Info: Material Request is not mandatory. It is ideal if you have centralized
buying so that you can collect this information from various departments.
