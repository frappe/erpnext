# Item Warranty

To track a warranty period, it is necessary that the Item is a serialized Item. When this Item is delivered, the delivery date and the expiry period is saved in the serial number master. Through the serial number master you can track the warranty status.

A warranty means a guarantee or a promise which provides assurance by one party to the other party which allows for a legal remedy if that promise is not true or followed. A warranty period is a time period in which a purchased product may be returned or exchanged.
