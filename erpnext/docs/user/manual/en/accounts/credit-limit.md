# Credit Limit

  

A credit limit is the maximum amount of credit that a financial institution or
other lender will extend to a debtor for a particular line of credit. From an
organisation's perspective, it is the maximum amount of credit which a
customer gets on goods purchased.  

To set credit limit go to Customer - Master

Go to the 'More Info section' and enter the amount in the field Credit Limit.

In case a need arises to allow more credit to the customer as a good-will, the
Credit Controller has access to submit order even if credit limit is crossed.

To allow any other role to submit transactions by customers whose credit limit
has expired, go to accounting settings and make changes.

In the field Credit Controller, select the role who would be authorized to
accept orders or raise credit limits of customers.
