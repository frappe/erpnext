# Email Digest

Email Digests allow you to get regular updates about your sales, expenses and other critical numbers directly in your Inbox.

Email Digests are a great way for top managers to keep track of the big numbers like “Sales Booked” or “Amount Collected” or “Invoices Raised” etc.

To set up Email Digest, go to:

> Setup > Email > Email Digest

## Example

Set your frequency, check all the items you want to receive in your weekly update and select the user ids whom you want to send the Digest to.
