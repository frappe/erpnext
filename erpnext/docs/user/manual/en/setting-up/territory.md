# Territory

If your business operates in multiple Territories (could be countries, states
or cities) it is usually a great idea to build your structure in the system.
Once you group your Customers by Territories, you can set annual targets for
each Item Group and get reports that will show your actual performance in the
territory v/s what you had planned.
You can also set different pricing for the same product sold across different territories.
