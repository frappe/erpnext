#### Difference between a customer name and a contact name

A customer name is the name of the organisation and a contact name is the name of the person from that organisation.

For Example: If American Power Mills is an organisation name and their founder Shiv Agarwal has installed ERPNext on his system. Then,

Customer Name: American Power Mills

Contact Name:  Shiv Agarwal
