### Letterhead

A letterhead is the heading at the top of a sheet of letter paper (stationery). That heading usually consists of a name and an address, and a logo or corporate design.

Click on the box ‘Attach Letterhead’ . Select the image file from the place it is stored and click enter.

You may choose to skip this step if your letterhead is not ready.

To select letterhead later through the setup module, read [Letter-head](/docs/user/manual/en/setting-up/print/letter-head.html)

#### To "attach as web-link"

For any attachments in ERPNext, you can also attach as a web-link. If you are using other tools like Dropbox or Google Docs to manage your files, you can set its public link.
