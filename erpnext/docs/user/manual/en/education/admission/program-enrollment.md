# Program Enrollment

**Program Enrollment** is the record of enrollment of a student in a given program and choose courses for a particular Academic Year and Academic Term (optional). If a student is enrolled in a program then his/her Program Enrollment must be created. The mandatory course in that program is automatically filled in Enrolled Courses table while the elective/optional courses can be selected manually.

If the student has applied online for the admission in a particular **Program** and the application is approved, then the Program Enrollment can be created from within the Student Applicant record via clicking on the **Enroll** button.

Else, to create the new Program Enrollment manually, go to:
> Education > Program Enrollment > New

If any institution has skipped the online admission process then Program Enrollment can also be considered as the confirmation of the admission in a particular Program.

> TIP: Academic Term is optional in the Program Enrollment. If your institution has only annual curriculum, you can skip the Academic Term

Student Batch: To categorize student into different sections/batches, you can assign the batch to the student. On the basis of this field, later student groups can be created.
