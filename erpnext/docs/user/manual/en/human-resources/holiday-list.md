#Holiday List

Holiday List is a list which contains the dates of holidays.

Most organisations have a standard Holiday-List for their employees. Some even have different holiday lists based on the different locations or departments.

To add a new Holiday List, go to:

`Human Resources (HR) > Leave and Holiday > Holiday List`

Click on New to add new Holiday List.
  
### New Holiday List

Give a name to Holiday List. It can be based in Fiscal Year or location or department as application. Also select From and To Date for the Holiday List.

After that, you can also add specific days (like festival holidays) manually.

### Holiday List in Employee

If you have created multiple Holiday List, then select specific Holiday List for an Employee in the respective master.

When an Employee applies for the Leave, then days mentioned in the Holiday List will not be counted, as they are holiday already. For more configuration option in Holiday List, check `HR > HR Settings`.

> Note 1: If you have specified a Holiday List in the Employment master, then that Holiday List will give priority the default Holiday List of the company.

> Note 2: You can form as many holiday lists as you wish. For example, if you have a factory, you can have one list for the factory workers and another list for office staff. You can manage between lists by attaching their respective holiday list to their respective employment detail form.
