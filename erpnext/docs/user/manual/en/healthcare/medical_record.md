# Patient Medical Record
The maintenance of complete and accurate medical records is a requirement of healthcare providers and is critical in rendering effective, high quality care. ERPNext Healthcare allows you to draw up the treatment history of a Patient anytime by merely selecting the Patient. "Medical Record" button is available in various screens so that you can easily switch to the Medical Record page to view the patient history.

Medical Record automatically keeps track of all Consultations, recorded Vital Signs, Lab Investigations etc. Complaints, Diagnosis etc. captured as part of consultation are easily viewable but to look at the details of other documents, links are provided.
