# Support

Great customer support and maintenance is at the heart of any successful small
business. ERPNext gives you the tools to track all incoming requests and issues
from your customers so that you can respond quickly. Your database of incoming
queries will also help you track where the biggest opportunities are for
improvements.

In this module, you can track incoming queries from your email using Support
Ticket. You can keep track on Customer Issues raised by Customers on specific
Serial No and respond to them based on their warranty and other information.
You can also make Maintenance Schedules for Serial Nos and keep a record of
all Maintenance Visits made to your Customers.
