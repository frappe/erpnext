# Warranty Claim

If you are selling **Items** under warranty or if you have sold and extended
service contract like the Annual Maintenance Contract (AMC), your **Customer**
may call you about an issue or a break-down and give you the Serial No of this
Item.

To record this, you can create a new **Warranty Claim** and add the
**Customer** and **Item** / **Serial No**. The system will then automatically
fetch the Serial No’s details and indicate whether this is under warranty or
AMC.

You must also add a description of the **Customer**’s issue and assign it to
the person who needs to look into solving the issue.

To create a new **Warranty Claim**:

> Support > Warranty Claim > New Warranty Claim

![Warranty Claim]({{docs_base_url}}/assets/img/support/warranty-claim.png)

If a Customer visit is required to address the issue, you can create a new
Maintenance Visit record from this.
