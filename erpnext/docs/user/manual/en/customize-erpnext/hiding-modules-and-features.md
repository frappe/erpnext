### Hiding Unused Features

As you have seen from this manual that ERPNext contains tons of features which
you may not use. We have observed that most users start with using 20% of the
features, though a different 20%. To hide fields belonging to features you
dont require, go to:

> Setup > Tools > Hide/Unhide Features

![Hide Features]({{docs_base_url}}/assets/old_images/erpnext/hide-features.png)

Check / uncheck the features you want to use and refresh your page for the
changes to take effect.

### Hiding Module Icons

To hide modules (icons) from the home page, go to:

Setup > Tools> Modules Setup

![Hide/Unhide Modules]({{docs_base_url}}/assets/old_images/erpnext/hide-module.png)

> Note: Modules are automatically hidden for users that have no permissions on
the documents within that module. For example, if a user has no permissions on
Purchase Order, Purchase Request, Supplier, the “Buying” module will
automatically be hidden.
