#Donor Type

The Donor Type doctype allows you to Create different Donor Profile for the Donor.

Donor Types are a basic building block for Donor and contribution management. Typically an organization will set up a donor type for each of the different donation that they offer. For example, an organisation may define three donation types for 'regular', 'Organization', and 'honorary' donor.

In this chapter we will cover the most common set-up for donor types.
